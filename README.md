## üìò Overview
QCalc is a Java-based calculator application aimed at reinforcing Java programming and OOP principles. This project covers the implementation of simple and scientific calculator features while handling exceptions and debugging issues. It‚Äôs built and tested with a focus on **Java**, **OOPs Principles**, and **Unit Testing**.

Throughout this project, we:
- Built calculator features following OOP principles.
- Handled exceptions to manage invalid data.
- Debugged and fixed issues in newly introduced calculator features.
- Utilized **VSCode** IDE to implement and test the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### 1. **Implement Simple Calculator**
   **Scope of Work:**
   - Created a **Java Gradle Project** using Spring Initializer Extension in **VSCode IDE**.
   - Developed basic arithmetic operations with two numbers and verified functionalities using unit tests.
   - Added floating point arithmetic operations using method overloading.

   **Skills Used:** `Java`, `Unit Testing`, `JUnit`

### 2. **Identify and Handle Exceptions**
   **Scope of Work:**
   - Managed exceptions for invalid data entries.
   - Validated exceptions through unit tests to ensure error handling accuracy.

   **Skills Used:** `Java`, `Unit Testing`, `JUnit`, `Exception Handling`

### 3. **Implement Scientific Calculator**
   **Scope of Work:**
   - Extended existing classes to add scientific calculator functionalities.
   - Reused and enhanced pre-existing features to support advanced calculations.

   **Skills Used:** `Java`

### 4. **Debug and Fix Issues**
   **Scope of Work:**
   - Resolved compilation errors related to syntax/import issues.
   - Corrected logical issues within the code and refined behavior for invalid data inputs.
   - Implemented unit tests for edge cases initially overlooked.

   **Skills Used:** `Java`, `Unit Testing`, `JUnit`, `Exception Handling`
